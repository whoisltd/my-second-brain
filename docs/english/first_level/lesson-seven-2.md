## Lesson Seven-2. Question in Present Tense

To make a question in the present tense, use the helping verbs **do** or **does**. In the chart below, the main verb is "walk". For questions, the main verb remains in the simple form.

| singular       | plural        |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Do i walk?     | Do we walk?   |
| Do you walk?   | Do you walk?  |
| Does he walk?  | Do they walk? |
| Does she walk? |               |
| Does it walks? |               |

Example:

Do you walk to school?

Does she walk to school?

Do students in your city walk to school?

**Note**:

Present tense questions require the helping verb and the main verb-except when the main verb is "be". Note the helping verb, do or does, changes with the subject.
