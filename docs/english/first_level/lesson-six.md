**Note**:

The word "there" can be singular or plural. It depends on the words that follow it.

- There <u>is</u> a **book** on the table (singular)
- There <u>are</u> three **books** on the table (plural)

When using "there" must think ahead to the noun that follows it. This noun is the subject. "These" is a *dummy* subject

"There" is used for information and facts. Sometimes "there" is singular, and sometimes "these" is plural

There is = There's. Most Americans use the contraction, there's

There are = (no contraction) Some Americans say "there's" even when the subject is plural. Shouldn't do that.
