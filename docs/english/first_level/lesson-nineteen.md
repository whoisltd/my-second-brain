## Lesson Nineteen. Count and Non-count Nouns

| Count nouns use singular and plural verbs and pronouns                               | Non-count nouns use only singular verbs and pronouns. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| There is an apple (singular)<br/>There are some apples (plural)                       | There is some fruit. (singular verb)                  |
| I like that chair ("that" is singular)<br/>She likes those chairs ("those" is plural) | I like that furniture                                 |
| Apples taste good                                                                    | Fruit tastes good                                     |
**Asking questions** for an amount or a number:

| Count Nouns                                       | Noncount Nouns                                                  |

| How many chairs are there?                        | How much furniture is there?<br/>There is a lot of turniture     |
| How many cameras are there?<br/>There's one camera | How much equipment is there?<br/>There's a lot of video equiment |

Non-count nouns don't use numbers:

- There is a lot of equipment
