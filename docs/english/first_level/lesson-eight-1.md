## Lesson Eight-1. The Present Continuous Tense

**S + (be) + ___ing**

| Singular         | Plural            |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| I am learning    | We are learning   |
| You are learning | You are learning  |
| He is learning   | They are learning |
| She is learning  |                   |
| It is learning   |                   |

Example:

He is learning English at school

They are learning English

**Note**:

The Present Continuous Tense usually describes **things that are happening now**, but it can also be used to describe **important things in your life**, and **future activity**.

Do not confuse the present continuous tense with the **"going to" future** or with **gerunds**

**Contractions:**

Subject + (be)
