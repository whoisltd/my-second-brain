## Lesson 27. Would Like

| singular       | plural          |

Would like = want
The verb 'would like' requires an object, a gerund, or an infinitive after it:
- I would like a bagel
- He'd like a new job ( Notice that the subject and "would" are contracted to form "He'd". This is very common)
- They'd like a new dog.
- They'd like to get a new dog
Most people make a contraction with the subject and "would"
I would like a burrito = I'd like a burrito
She would like to make a call = She'd like to make a call
