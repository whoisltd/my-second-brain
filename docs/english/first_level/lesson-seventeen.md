## Lesson Seventeen. Verbs for Asking About and Telling Time

Important verbs for asking about and telling time: have, know, be , tell

| Question                              | Answer                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Do you *have* the time?               | Sure, it's 6:00                |
| Do you know what time it is?          | Sorry, I'm not wearing a watch |
| What time is it                       | 5:50                           |
| Can you tell what time it is, please? | It's quarter after two         |
**Important vocabulary for telling time**
- o'lock = :00 (7:00 = seven o'clock)
- a quarter after = 15 minutes after the hour (3:15 = It's a quarter after three)
- a quarter past = 15 minutes after the hour (3:15 = It's a quarter after three)
- a quarter before = 15 minutes before the hour (3:45 = It's a quarter before four)
- a quarter to = 15 minutes before the hour (3:45 = It's a quarter to four)
- half past = 30 minutes after the hour (3:30 = It's half past three)
- thirty = 30 minutes after the hour (3:30 = Its three thirty)
The easiest way to tell someone the time is to use a digital format. For example, when someone asks you what time it is, you can say, "it's 5:30". Instead of, "It's half past five".
"It's 5:13" = (five thirteen) or
"It's 5:02" = (five o two)*
or "It's 5:50" (five fifty)
*Note: 0 is pronounced "O" note "zero"*

**Giving the Date**


| Question                                     | Answers                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| What's today?<br/>or<br/>What day is it today? | Today's Tuesday, June 6.<br/>(June sixth) |
| What's the date?                             | It's June 6. or It's the 6th of June     |
There's a difference between "day" and "date"
- day: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.
- date: June 6
When someone asks you the date, it's not necessary to give the year
For example:
- What's the date? -> It's June 6.
When someone asks about time in the future or the past, use the year.
- When were you born? -> March 25. 1965
- When did you arrive in the U.S.? -> In 2012
- When is the next election? -> In November of 2020
