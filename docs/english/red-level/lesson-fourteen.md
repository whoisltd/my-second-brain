## Lesson 14. Adjectives

Adjectives are words that describe nouns and pronouns.

- This is an ==_old_== radio (The word "old") is an adjective
- This is a ==_hungry_== cat.
- The banana is ==_yellow_==
- His glass is ==_empty_==
- Are you _==aware==_ of the news?
- She's _==Japanese==_
  In English, adjectives usually go before a noun, but they sometimes appear after a noun if using the verb "be" as in the examples above. The banana is ==_yellow_==
- This is a yellow banana
- This is a banana _==yellow==_
  English adjectives also don't take a plural form. They're always singular. The only time an adjective changes is in the comparative and superlative forms
