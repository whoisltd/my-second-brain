## Lesson 13. Like

The word "like" gets special attention in this level because it's a popular word in English. Under standing how to use "like" is important.

1. "Like" expresses your happiness with something or someone
   1. I like this ice cream
   2. I like my neighbors
2. "Like" is used to make comparisons and to ask questions about people and things:
   1. What is it like to live in Minnesota in January?
   2. It's like living in Siberia
   3. Why is he like that?
   4. I don't know. He's just naturally a mean person
   - A cantaloupe is like a honeydew melon or use kind of like:
     kind of like = similar to
   - A honeydew melon tastes kind of like a cantaloupe
3. "Like" is often used with "would" as a polite way to asking what a person wants. You often hear this in restaurants.
   1. What would you like to have for lunch?
      - I'd like a veggie sub, french fries, and a coke. ( I'd like = I would like)
4. "how do you like..." is used to ask if someone likes something. It's very similar to "Do you like\_\_\_?"
   1. How do you like living in this city?
      - It's great. I really like it
   2. How do you like your pizza?
      - It's awesome!
5. "Like" sometimes doesn't mean anything at all. Americans use it in the same way they use "you know" and "uuhhh..." Try to avoid doing this when you speak English. It's a bat habit. Teenagers use this "like" a lot. 1. That movie was, like, so good. 2. I was, like, really mad at my teacher because he gave me a bad grade, and he was, like, "Here. you earned this."
   Warning: "I like" The verb should have an object somewhere after it.

- Do you like this car?
- ~~Yes, I like~~ (incorrect)
- Yes, I like it (correct) or... I like this car
