## Lesson 7. Special Uses for the Verb "do"

The verb "do" is a little confusing. Not only is a helping verb, it's a main verb as well. For example, to ask someone about his or her job, say...
"what do you do?"
The first verb in that question is a helping verb, do; the second verb in that question is the main verb, do.
Examples:
What do you do? -> I'm a cashier.
It's interesting to note that the answer does not require the verb do. In this case the answer uses the verb be.
What do you do at work? -> i help customers
What do you do everyday? -> i go to school

- What did they do?
	- They got married
- What is he doing?
	- He's smoking
But sometimes "do" is used as the main verb.

In fact, "do" is a very popular main verb for some activities. It can be used for exercising, studying, cleaning, working, and other general behavior.
