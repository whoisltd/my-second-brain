## Lesson 2. Do - Making the negative

| Singular                     | Plural                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| _I_ do not = I don’t         | _We_ do not = We don’t     |
| _You_ do not = You don’t     | _You_ do not = You don’t   |
| _He_ does not = He doesn’t   |                            |
| _She_ does not = She doesn’t | _They_ do not = They don’t |
| _It_ does not = It doesn’t   |                            |
Do + not = don't
Does + not = doesn't

**The verb "do" is a helping verb. Use :do: to make the present tense and the past tense negative. The verb "do" is also a main verb**

Examples in the present tense:
- I don't work on the weekend.
- He doesn't like to go to the store
- They don't have any money

The past tense form of "do" is "did". Did + not = didn't
- He didn't work last night
- She didn't go shopping yesterday.
- We didn't see that movie yet.
**Be careful: "Do" is also sued as a main verb, but only for particular activities, such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, business, and shopping.**

Examples in the present tense:
- I don't do the dishes every night.
- She doesn't do her grocery shopping at Cub.
- They do not do their homework at the library.
- Their company doesn't do business in Minnesota
Examples in the past tense
- I didn't do the dishes last night.
- She didn't do her grocery shopping at Cub

Separating the contraction creates emphasis
Examples:
- I do not want to do the dishes!
- he does not have dis license!
- Please, do not put that hot pan on the counter!
**Never put do + not + ______ing**
- He ~~*doesn't going*~~ to work (incorrect)
- He doesn't go to work (correct)
**Avoid bad American grammar!**
- She ~~don't go~~ to work on Sunday
- It ~~don't matter~~ to me
- He ~~don't know~~
