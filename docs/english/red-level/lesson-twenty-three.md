## Lesson 23. Used to

"Used to" describes activities in the past. Something was once true, but now the situation is different. Following "used to," the main verb is in the simple form:
Subject + used to + \_\_\_ (main verb)

- Soldiers used to use knives, swords, and shields when fighting. Now they use guns.
