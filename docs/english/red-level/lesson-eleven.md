## Lesson 11. The Future Tense - Will \_\_

| Singular | Plural    |
| -------- | --------- |
| I will   | We will   |
| You will | You will  |
| He will  | They will |
| She will |           |
| It will  |           |

contractions + main verb:

| Singular | Plural  |
| -------- | ------- |
| I'll     | we'll   |
| You'll   | You'll  |
| He'll    | They'll |
| She'll   |         |
| It'll    |         |

Examples:

- I'll go to class tomorrow and teach English
- You'll go to class tomorrow and learn English
- It'll probably snow this week
- You'll be there, too!
  **Another way to make the future tense is by using "(be) going to.**
  I will see my friends on the weekend
  I am going to see my friends on the weekend
  The meaning is the same in both sentences, but the "going to" future is often preferred because it sounds a little more relaxed and conversational.
