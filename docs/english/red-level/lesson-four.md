## Lesson 4. Commands

Also known as the _imperative form_, commands are very easy to use. Begin the sentence with a verb and end with an object, a person or a thing.
Tell someone do something:

- Answer the phone, please
- Drive to the post office
- Help me find this information
  **The subject in each of these sentences is "you," but it doesn't sound correct to use the subject.**
- ~~You answer the phone, please.~~
- ~~You drive to the post office~~
- ~~You help me~~
  **Tell someone not to do something:**
- Don't do that (the subject is "you")
- Don't hit him
- Don't drive a car without a seat belt
  **In each sentence above, the present tense is used and the subject is "you"**
- Please give that to me
- Pass the potatoes, please. (use the word "pass" when you set at a table with other people and eat food)
- If some one doesn't do what you wanted him or her to do, use the word "tell".
