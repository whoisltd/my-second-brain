| It      | Its                  | Its<br/>The strawberry is red<br/>**Its skin is red** ("Its" is hard to use as a possessive pronoun. It's often better to use the possessive adjective instead)                                                                                                             |

| They    | Their                | Theirs<br/>My dog is brown<br/>**Theirs are gold**<br/>Note: it's also possible to say, "Theirs is gold" if they have just one dog. A possessive pronoun is singular or plural depending on the antecent. An "antecedent" is the word or words to which the pronoun refers. |
