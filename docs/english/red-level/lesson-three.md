The verb "do" is a helping verb. We add it to the simple form of a verb to make question and negatives in the present tense and the past tense.
Examples:
I don't work on the weekend
I didn't work last weekend
He doesn't like to go to the store
He didn't like to go to the store when he was younger
They don't have any money
They didn't have any money last week

**Note: "Do" is also used as a main verb for activities, such as house work , cleaning, studying, research, business, and shopping.**
Examples:

- I don't do the dishes every night. I didn't do the dishes last night.
- She doesn't do her grocery shopping at Cub. She didn't do her grocery shopping yesterday.
- They do not do their homework at the library. They didn't do their homework last night.
- Their company doesn't do business in Minnesota. They never did business here.
  **The past tense form of "do" is "did". Did + not = didn't**
  Examples:
  I don't do the dishes every night. I didn't do the dishes last night
  She doesn't do her grocery shopping at Cub. She didn't do her grocery shopping yesterday.
  They do not do their homework at the library. They didn't do their homework last night.
  Their company doesn't do business in Minnesota. They never did business here.
  **The past tense form of "do" is "did". Did + not = didn't**
  Examples:
  I didn't go to work yesterday
  She didn't take the bus to work
  **Separating the contraction creates emphasis**
  Examples:
  I did not want to do the dishes last night. I do not want to do them now!
  He does not have his license! he never did get it
  Please, do not put that hot pan on the counter
  **Never put "did" + ing together**
  He ~~did going~~ to work last night (incorrect)
  He went to work last night (correct)
  **Avoid bad American grammar**
  She ~~don't go~~ to work on Sunday (incorrect)
  She doesn't go to work on Sunday (correct)
