## Lesson 10. A lot / some / any

a lot of = many or much

- There is a lot of traffic on one side of the street
- There are a lot of cars on one side of the street
  (A lot of traffic = many cars)

not a lot of = not many or not much

- There isn't a lot of traffic on the other side
- There are some cars but not very many
  (some = a relatively small amount but "some" is not easy to quantify or equate to a particular number)
- There were a lot of people at the beach yesterday
- There aren't a lot of people at the beach today
- There aren't many people at the beach today
- There are some but not many
  use "any" with negatives and questions.
- There isn't any traffic in the street.
- There aren't any cars. (not any = 0)
- Do you see any people?
  A lot, some, and any are used with indefinite amounts:
  Example:
- How many students are there in the classroom
- There are a lot (or)
- There are some students (this is a small number but the number is not known) (or)
- There aren't any students ( this is zero or a very, very small number and the number is not known)
