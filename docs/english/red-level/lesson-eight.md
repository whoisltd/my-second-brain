It's important to understand the difference between non-count and count nouns when using many and much. Non-count nouns are often used to describe large categories while count nouns are usually more specific.

Examples:
- There is a car in the street.
- How many cars are in the street?
	- There are a few cars in the street (plural count noun)
- How much traffic is there?
	- There is a lot of traffic (non-count noun)\
Non-count nouns always use a singular verb. Count nouns are singular or plural
**Much and Many are usually used with the negative**
Examples:
- There aren't many students in the classroom. (perhaps 4 or 5 students)
- There isn't much food in the refrigerator. (a small amount of food)
**Any + not, never, or without expresses zero:**
Examples:
- There aren't any students in the classroom (zero)
- There isn't any food in the refrigerator. It's empty
- He went outside without any shoes. (There are no shoes on his feet)
- They never want to eat any vegetables or drink any milk
**Much and Many are usually not used in the affirmative:**
Examples:
- There are many apples in the basket. It sounds better to say...
- There are a lot of apples in the basket
- There is much milk in the refrigerator. It sounds better to say...
- There is a lot of milk in the refrigerator
