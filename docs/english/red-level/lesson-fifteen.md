## Lesson 15. Conjunctions

Conjunctions are useful in putting nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and clauses together when making sentences. There are seven coordination conjunctions: and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so

Examples:
I like to eat chess **and** crackers.
Use "and" when putting two or more things or people together in a group

Hockey is a fun sport, **but** sometimes you can fall and hurt yourself.
"But" is a word that shows contrast or differences. Hockey is fun, but it is also a little dangerous. Fun but dangerous.

Would you like to eat a hotdog **or** a hamburger?
"Or" provides you with a choice or a decision

She eats neither hotdogs **nor** hamburgers. She prefers vegetables.
"Nor" is the negative form of "or". It's often used with "neither."

He went to prison, **for** he had killed someone.
"For" is very similar to "because" and "since". This is a difficult conjunction to use. It sounds very formal.

It's cold outside, **yet** these boys don't want to go inside because they are having so much fun.
"Yet" is similar to "but." In this usage it's not the same as the "yet" which is used to express time.

She saw a spider, **so** she became afraid.
"So" is similar to "because" and "for" but you can't use the word in the same position. The same sentence about could be written:
She became afraid **because** she saw a spider
