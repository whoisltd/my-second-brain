## Lesson 18. Gerunds

Gerunds, like infinitives, look like verbs, but they actually function as nouns. Consider the following sentences:

- I like going to the beach. ("like" is the verb; "going" is the gerund)
- Playing volleyball at the beach is fun ("Playing" is the gerund and functions as the subject)
- I like eating cold pizza
  Gerunds are often confused with verbs. Because gerunds take an "ing" ending, some students mistake them for verbs in the continuous form. If you don't see the verb "be" in front of a word with an "ing" ending. It's probably a gerund. For example, which sentence has a gerunds?

1. He thinks that **learning** English is important for his career
2. This morning, they're meeting their friends at the airport
   Examples:

- I like **listening** to the radio
- He likes **eating** popcorn when he goes to see a movie
- **Playing** in the snow is one of life's greatest pleasures
- **Drinking** coffee in the morning is one of my favorite things to do
- He finds **playing** the guitar to be **relaxing**

One more thing: Don't confuse gerunds with the present continuous tense!
