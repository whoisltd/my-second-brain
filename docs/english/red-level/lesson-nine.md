## Lesson 9. a few / a little

Few is used with count nouns:
a few = 3-4 few = a small amount

- How many cars are there?

  - There are just a few (a few = 3 or 4)

- There are a few bananas on the table.

- She's sad because she has very few friends.

(This means she doesn't have many friends. Notice there is no article. "A few" means something different.)

- Few people were at the meeting. She expected 20, but only three came.
  ( In this example and the one above, the situation is not good.)

- Little is used with non-count nouns
  a little / little = a small amount
- He dropped a little paint on his wife's head.

You can also use ... a little bit of

- He dropped a little bit of paint on his wife's head.
- There's a little snow on the road and on the ground
- He got very little sleep last night.
  (Notice that "sleep" is a noun in this sentence.
  "A little sleep" is a small amount of sleep, and "little sleep" is not very much sleep or no sleep.)

- Did she find what she was looking for in the newspaper?
  - No. There was very little information
