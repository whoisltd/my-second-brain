## Lesson 9. Past Tense vs. Past Continuous Tense

Past tense: I went to word yesterday
Past tense negative: I didn't go to work on Sunday.

Past continuous tense: I was eating my breakfast when the phone rang
Past continuous negative: I wasn't eating anything when the phone rang

The past continuous tense is often used when talking about on e or more past actions that happen at the same time

Here are some examples:
While I was sleeping, someone broke into my car and stole it.
Sarah's phone rang just as she was walking into the classroom
John was sitting at his desk when he suddenly noticed there was a dead mouse on the floor

Examples:
What was the boy doing at the park?
He was making sand castles.
This boy made sand castles while he was playing in the sand

The past tense is an alter native to the past continuous tense:

I was drinking coffee while i was working on my computer
_sound better than..._
I drank my coffee when I worked on my computer
_... because there's some activity._
