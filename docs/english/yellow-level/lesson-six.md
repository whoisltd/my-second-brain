## Lesson 6. The Comparative Form for Adjectives

Use "er" at the end of small words. (one syllable)
Use "more" in front of long words (2+ syllables)

A lion is bigger than a cat
A lion is more dangerous than a cat

The children playing with the blocks are younger than the students going to school.

Here are some more examples:

Saving money this year has been more difficult than last year

Japanese cars are much better than most American cars.

Spanish is an easier language to learn than English.

Note: It's not always necessary to use "than"

Compared to last year, saving money this year has been more difficult

Compared to American cars, Japanese cars are much better.

Compared to English, Spanish is an easier language.

The comparative form is used to show the difference between two things or two people, two groups of things, or two groups of people.

There are rules for using the comparative form.

One syllable words -> add **er**
Two syllable words ending in y -> drop the **y** and add **ier**
Two syllables or more not ending in y -> use **more** / don't add **er**

There are some exceptions: good, bad, far, and fun are adjectives that don't follow the rules when making the comparative form.
good -> better, bad -> worse, far -> farther, fun -> more fun

Never use two comparatives together on an adjective:
~~more cheaper~~
~~more noisier~~
~~more older~~
