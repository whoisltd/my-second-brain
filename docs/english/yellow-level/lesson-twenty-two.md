## Lesson 22. Comparative Adverbs

Adverbs in the comparative form describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.
Adverbs usually end in "ly"

Making the comparative form for adverbs is not as easy as making the comparative form for adjectives. Remember, most adverbs end in "ly", so most adverbs are two-syllable words; therefore, you will usually use "more" in front of the adverb to make the comparison.

Many Americans ignore the rules for comparative adverbs, but you should still learn how to use them properly.

A subway train can get you through the city more quickly than a bus
("more quickly" describes the verb "get" "Get" is a verb)

A laptop computer allows her to do her work more efficiently

Barack Obama campaigned more skillfully than his opponents, and that's one reason why he won his election

Some adverbs have only one syllable and don't add "ly"

fast, hard, soon, high

She works faster than he does
He can reach higher than she can
They'll finish their work sooner than they did last week

The opposite of "more" is "less"
He is less easily disturbed by her behavior than he was in the past.
