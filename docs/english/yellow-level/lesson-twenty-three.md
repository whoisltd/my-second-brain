## Lesson 23. Superlative Adverbs

Adverbs in the superlative form describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.

Adverbs usually end in "ly"

Making the superlative form fro adverbs is even more difficult than the comparative form. Many Americans avoid doing it, so you might not hear it used very often.

He rides his bike most frequently in the morning

I work at school and at home during the week, but I work most comfortably at my desk on the weekend

She is most likely to become a doctor after she finishes med school

Birds sing most beautifully in the morning

Some adverbs don't use "ly" endings. For these words, just add "est"
They play well together, but they play best when they're under pressure.
They perform the worst on the field when they don't practice.
John is the hardest working player on the team
Burt runs the fastest, so he's a wide receiver
