## Lesson 12. Perfect Modal Verbs

Modal verb + have + past participle

Perfect modals take a modal verb (could, should, must, might/may) and pairs it with a perfect tense phrase (have + past participle), which is how it gets its name. Don't let the vocabulary confuse you! When we say perfect modals, we are not saying that these are models that are perfect

Pay attention to the construction and use of each, as these phrases are very common in English you will hear them often and will need to use them. Overall, perfect modals allow you to talk about possibilities or regret

As an added bonus, one What way to remember this type of construction? take a listen to one of the most popular American songs, "It Must Have Been Love" and you will never use it incorrectly!

Le's not forget ...
The Future Perfect Tense
Unlike all the other modals above, will is used for the future:
Subject + will + have + past participle

| Singular            | Plural               |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| I will have lived   | We will have lived   |
| You will have lived | You will have lived  |
| He will have lived  | They will have lived |
| She will have lived |                      |
| It will have lived  |                      |

This is difficult tense to use. It describes an action that will be completed in the future.

For example:
I moved to Minnesota in 1991. The year now is 2008
By 2011, I will have lived in Minnesota for 20 years.
