## Lesson 16. Direct and Indirect Quotations

A "quotation" is the exact word or words that a person speaks. It's good to understand the difference between a direct quotation the words you hear from someone speaking, and an indirect quotation which are the words that someone else used to describe another speaker. Confused? When you're confused it helps to look at an example.

Direct Quotation ( Direct Speech)
"I need to go to the store" said my wife

Indirect Quotation (Indirect Speech)
My wife said that she needed to go to the store

Notice that "said" is in the past tense, so the verb "need" also becomes past tense.
There's something called the "sequence of tenses" which is useful to look at now:

**The Sequence of Tenses**

**Direct Speech -> Indirect Speech**
Present -> Past
Present Continuous -> Past Continuous
Past -> Past Perfect
Present Perfect -> Past Perfect
Present Perfect -> Past Perfect

There are other tenses that could be added here, but this is a good start in learning that tenses change their form when using indirect speech. See the examples below.

"I am a beekeeper"
