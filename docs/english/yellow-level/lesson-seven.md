## Lesson 7. Superlative Adjectives

Differences in 3+ things or 3+ people
Add "est" or "most" when forming superlative adjectives.

The lion is the biggest animal in this group
(There are three animals)

The lion is also the most dangerous animal in this group

Remember: The superlative form is used to show the difference among three or more things or people in a group.

There are rules for using the superlative form.

One-syllable words -> add **est**
Two-syllable words ending in y -> drop the y and ad **iest**
Two syllables or more not ending in y -> use most / don't add **est**

There are some exceptions: good, bad, far, and fun are adjectives that don't follow the rules when making the comparative form.

good -> best, bad -> worst, far -> farthest, fun -> most fun

Never use two superlatives together on an adjective:
~~most cheapest~~
~~most noisiest~~
It's often necessary to use "the" in front of the superlative:

1. Apples picked directly from a tree taste the best
2. I had the most fun at the state fair when I rode on the ferris wheel
3. Giraffes have the longest necks of any animal
   Sometimes an article such as "the" isn't necessary when using the superlative. Instead, you can use the possessive form in front of the superlative.

Examples:
This dog is her best friend.
Her best friend is her dog
