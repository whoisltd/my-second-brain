## Lesson 29. Number + noun = adjective

It's very common in English to put two words together in order to form an adjective. In this lesson, you'll learn how to put a number and a noun together to form an adjective that describes another noun.

Example:

| number | noun  | noun     | result            |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | ----------------- |
| two    | car   | garage   | two-car garage    |
| 25     | story | building | 25-story building |
| five   | star  | hotel    | five-star hotel   |
| 48     | hour  | wait     | 48-hour wait      |

You must hyphenate the number word and the noun. These two words together function as an adjective. - (hyphen)

Notice that numbers ten and under are usually spelled out completely. If you write 2-car garage, for instance, it looks awkward.
