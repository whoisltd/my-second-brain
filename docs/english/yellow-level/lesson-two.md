## Lesson 2. have - present and past tense

"**Have**" is a verb that has the forms 'has', 'having', and 'had' with **have** being the base form. It can be either a helping verb or a main verb.

This is a word often used in English, one that will become even more important as your language skills grow. It is important to be able to confidently use **have/had**. To start you off on the right foot, let's take a closer look at this word.

One way "have/has" is used is to show possession:

He has two sisters
I have a small dog
We have class tomorrow

You use this word to talk about possessing something. Here's the breakdown of how to use it for different subjects in the present tense:


| Present Tense |           |
| ------------- | --------- |
| I have        | We have   |
| You have      | You have  |
| He has        | They have |
| She has       |           |
| It has        |           |
Talking about something you owned in the past? With this word, it's nice and easy. Just drop the ve/s and add a *d*:

| Past Tense |          |
| ---------- | -------- |
| I had      | We had   |
| You had    | You had  |
| He had     | They had |
| She had    |          |
| It had     |          |

This word is going to be an important part of your English language abilities. It is the foundation of conversation. You will need it to talk about your family ("I have a brother"), your schedule ("I have class today"), and your tasks ("I have so much homework"). Later, it will become even more important as you use it as a block to build more complex sentences. So, master it now and learn to use it confidently. It will serve you well in the future of your studies.
