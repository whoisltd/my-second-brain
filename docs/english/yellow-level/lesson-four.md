## Lesson 4. The Present Perfect Tense - Negative

S + _have_ or _has_ + not + past participle

| Singular            | Plural               |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| I have not worked   | We have not worked   |
| You have not worked | You have not worked  |
| He has not worked   | They have not worked |
| She has not worked  |                      |

Notice the use of "has" for a man, a woman, or thing.
Also, it's important to know the irregular past participles

Most Americans use the contracted form:
have + not = haven't / has + not = hasn't
