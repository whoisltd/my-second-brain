## Lesson Five. this / that / these / those

**this / that / these / those**

| This <br/>A thing or a person is close<br />This = singular<br/><br/> | That<br/>A thing or a person is far<br/>That = singular |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| These<br/>Things or people are close<br/>These = plural      | Those<br/>Things or people are far<br/>Those = plural   |

Example:

*This* pencil is my hand is yellow

*These* pencils are not very sharp

*That* car across the street is red

*Those* cars in the parking lot are blue

**Note**:

"That" is often contracted with the singular form of the verb "be"

That is a window = That's a window

"That's" usually sounds much better than to say, "That is"

This, these, and those can't take contractions
