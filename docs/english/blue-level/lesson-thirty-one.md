## Lesson 31. Plural Nouns and Verbs
**Plural Verbs**
The most important thing to remember about plural verbs is that they don't end in an "s". The plural verb matches the plural subject, which is a noun, but don't add an "s" to the verb. 
Examples:
- The books belong on the shelf
- When do the students start school?
- What do they need for class?
In the first sentence, "belong" matches the subject, "books."There is no 's' at the end of "belong", but it's a plural verb.
Both "belong" and "books" are plural. In the next two sentences, the helping verb "do" is also plural, while the main verbs, "start" and "need" remain in the simple form.

**Plural Helping Verbs**
Plural nouns are easier to identify than the plural verbs. Plural nouns have an "s" at the end of the word, or there is some other way of forming the plural. In some cases, It;s hard to identify the plural noun because it has an irregular form.
Here are some examples of regular nouns in the plural form:
- The desks all have computers
- Apples are good for you
- The tags show the wrong price
Irregular nouns in the plural form
- Several referenda are on the ballot
- The deer like to eat the bark on this tree
- Children learn things in school
Fortunately, there aren't that many nouns that take an irregular, plural form. Most are for certain animals such as deer, mice, geese, and fish among others. Some words from Latin are plural: bacteria, criteria, and fungi are a few examples. Then there are the common plural forms for men. women, end children

- Oranges are my favorite fruit
- The fishes are in the water
- Fruits from around the world are available at that store
- The men need to get their uniforms cleaned
- Th stimuli have an interesting affect on the nervous system
