## Lesson Nine. Have (present tense)

**S + has/have**

| Singular | Plural    |
| -------- | --------- |
| I have   | We have   |
| You have | You have  |
| He has   | They have |
| She has  |           |
| It has   |           |

"**Have**" is usually used for ownership, ability, or for a description...

- I have a new car
- They have time to go to the movies
- She has brown eyes
- He has a beard

...but the word "have" is also a very popular substitute fro the words "**eat**" and "**drink**"

- She has coffee every morning
- (She drinks coffee every morning)
- He has pancakes for breakfast
- (He eats pancakes for breakfast)



**Have** is also an important **helping verb:**

- I have lived in Minnesota for three years

In the example above, (have) + (past participle) make the present perfect tense

**Example:**

- I have glasses
- You have sunglasses
- He has a gun
- She has a tricycle
- The cake has a lot of fruit on top of it

**Note:**

To make "have" negative in the present tense, use don't or doesn't have

**Correct**: He doesn't have any money.

**Incorrect**: He hasn't any money (but okey in British English)

Have - Present Tense (negative with contraction)

**S + don't / doesn't + have**
