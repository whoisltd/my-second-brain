## Lesson 22. Addition and Subtraction in English

addition or adding
5 + 3 = 8
five plus three equals 8
2 + 2 = 4
two and two is 4
**Note:** Some English books will use the plural verb "equal" or "are" for the equal sign (=). Grammatically, this is correct but most people use a singular verb.

What's two plus two?

Subtraction or subtracting
5 - 3 = 2
five minus three equals two
10 - 7 = 3
ten take away seven is three
**Note:** The first example (using "minus") is preferred over the second, but "take away" is popular.

**Addition:**
- What do you get if you add six and eight together?
- You get 14

- If you put two and two together, what do you get?
- You get four

- If you add 20 to 30, what does that make?
- That makes 50
The word "make" is often used when counting money
**Subtraction:**
- What do you get if you subtract five from nine?
- You get four

- How much do you have if you take three away from seven
- You have four
