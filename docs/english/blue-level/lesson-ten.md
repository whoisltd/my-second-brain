## Lesson Ten. Articles A / An / The

| Singular | Plural |
| -------- | ------ |
| a /an    | the    |
| the      | ___    |

Articles are used in front of [nouns](lesson-four.md)

"A" or "an" are always singular

"The" is singular or plural

Some plural nouns don't use an article

When using articles, it's important to also know the difference between [count and noncount nouns](lesson-nineteen.md)

**Example**:

- I have glasses (plural - <s>a/an</s>) Or ... I have a pair of glasses

- You have a hat (singular count noun) But... the second time you describe that hat, you say: The hat is blue
- Have has some strawberries (plural count noun). The strawberries are in his mouth (second mention)
- She has a popsicle (singular count noun) The popsicle tastes good! or ... Popsicles tast good
- That cat has some water (Water is a non-count noun <s>a/an</s>) The water is in a bowl. The bowl is purple
- We have time to learn English. (time and English are noncount nouns. Sometimes the is used; sometimes it isn't) I + you = we
- They have a good relationship. (relationship is a singular count noun)
- All three children have popsicles. The popsicles test good. (Popsicle is a plural count noun)

There are a lot of rules for articles:

1. Don't put an article in front of the name of a place

   - Correct: Minneapolis is a great city
   - Not correct: <s>The</s> Minneapolis is a great city

   But it is correct to use the name of a place as an adjective:

   - The Minneapolis skyline is beautiful at night
   - The Chicago River is painted green on St.Patrick's Day

2. Indefinite amounts or general qualities don't take an article

   - Pennies are made of cooper
   - The copper in this penny is turning brown. (This is a specific amount)
   - Water is good for you
   - The water in this glass tastes bad. (This is a specific amount)
   - Honesty is the best policy

3. Don't use an article with possessive nouns or pronouns

   â€‹	This is <s>the</s> Paul's website

4. The definite article can be used with singular or plural nouns:

   - The apples taste great (plural)
   - The apple tastes great (singular)
   - Apples taste great (general category)
   - The water is clean
   - Water is necessary for life
