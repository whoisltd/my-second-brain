| You were | You were  |
| He was   |           |
| She was  | They were |
| It was   |           |
I was in my classroom yesterday
You were there, too
He was at a movie last night
She was at home

To make a question...

Examples:
- Was I late?
- Were you in school yesterday?
- Was he at work this morning?
- Was she tired?
- Was the movie good?
- Were we too loud?
